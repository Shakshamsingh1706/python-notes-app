# python-notes-app
i take a notes app from Shubhum Londhe's repository. Then, i containerize the application using Docker. Next, i automate the build and deployment process by setting up a Jenkins pipeline step to Dockerize the app. Finally, you push the Docker image to Docker Hub for storage and distribution.
